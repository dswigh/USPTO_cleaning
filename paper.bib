	abstract = {Chemical reaction data in journal articles, patents, and even electronic laboratory notebooks are currently stored in various formats, often unstructured, which presents a significant barrier to downstream applications, including the training of machine-learning models. We present the Open Reaction Database (ORD), an open-access schema and infrastructure for structuring and sharing organic reaction data, including a centralized data repository. The ORD schema supports conventional and emerging technologies, from benchtop reactions to automated high-throughput experiments and flow chemistry. The data, schema, supporting code, and web-based user interfaces are all publicly available on GitHub. Our vision is that a consistent data representation and infrastructure to support data sharing will enable downstream applications that will greatly improve the state of the art with respect to computer-aided synthesis planning, reaction prediction, and other predictive chemistry tasks.},

Such a database not only would serve chemical sciences and technologies around the world but also would enable the power of modern AI and machine learning methods to be unleashed on a host of fundamental problems. In time, this could lead to important scientific discoveries and economic developments for the benefit of humanity. While ideally such a repository ought to be created and maintained by an international consortium, in the near future, it may be easier to begin the process through governmental agencies such as the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health. Working together, we could use a multipronged approach that could combine negotiations with commercial stakeholders, crowd-sourcing efforts, automated extraction methods, and legislative actions.},

	abstract = {Organic reactions are usually assigned to classes containing reactions with similar reagents and mechanisms. Reaction classes facilitate the communication of complex concepts and efficient navigation through chemical reaction space. However, the classification process is a tedious task. It requires identification of the corresponding reaction class template via annotation of the number of molecules in the reactions, the reaction centre and the distinction between reactants and reagents. Here, we show that transformer-based models can infer reaction classes from non-annotated, simple text-based representations of chemical reactions. Our best model reaches a classification accuracy of 98.2\%. We also show that the learned representations can be used as reaction fingerprints that capture fine-grained differences between reaction classes better than traditional reaction fingerprints. The insights into chemical reaction space enabled by our learned fingerprints are illustrated by an interactive reaction atlas providing visual clustering and similarity searching.},

	abstract = {Fingerprint methods applied to molecules have proven to be useful for similarity determination and as inputs to machine-learning models. Here, we present the development of a new fingerprint for chemical reactions and validate its usefulness in building machine-learning models and in similarity assessment. Our final fingerprint is constructed as the difference of the atom-pair fingerprints of products and reactants and includes agents via calculated physicochemical properties. We validated the fingerprints on a large data set of reactions text-mined from granted United States patents from the last 40 years that have been classified using a substructure-based expert system. We applied machine learning to build a 50-class predictive model for reaction-type classification that correctly predicts 97\% of the reactions in an external test set. Impressive accuracies were also observed when applying the classifier to reactions from an in-house electronic laboratory notebook. The performance of the novel fingerprint for assessing reaction similarity was evaluated by a cluster analysis that recovered 48 out of 50 of the reaction classes with a median F-score of 0.63 for the clusters. The data sets used for training and primary validation as well as all python scripts required to reproduce the analysis are provided in the Supporting Information.},

Indigo toolkit. While typically correct, the atom-maps are wrong in many
cases and hence should not be entirely relied on.The reactions have been filtered to remove common cases of incorrectly extracted reactions:All product atoms must be accounted for by the atom-mappingThe product(s) must have {\textgreater}8 heavy atomsThe product must not be charged if it is a single componentThe number of products must be {\textless}5 and number of reactants+agents {\textless}16CML:A schema for the CML is present in cml\_xsd.zipReaction SMILESFor convenience the reaction SMILES includes tab delimited columns for:PatentNumber, ParagraphNum, Year, TextMinedYield, CalculatedYieldAll of this information is also present in the CML (year is inferred from the folders)},

	abstract = {Research in chemistry increasingly requires interdisciplinary work prompted by, among other things, advances in computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Everyone working with molecules, whether chemist or not, needs an understanding of the representation of molecules in a machine-readable format, as this is central to computational chemistry. Four classes of representations are introduced: string, connection table, feature-based, and computer-learned representations. Three of the most significant representations are simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES), International Chemical Identifier (InChI), and the MDL molfile, of which SMILES was the first to successfully be used in conjunction with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to yield a continuous representation of molecules. This is noteworthy because a continuous representation allows for efficient navigation of the immensely large chemical space of possible molecules. Since 2018, when the first model of this type was published, considerable effort has been put into developing novel and improved methodologies. Most, if not all, researchers in the community make their work easily accessible on GitHub, though discussion of computation time and domain of applicability is often overlooked. Herein, we present questions for consideration in future work which we believe will make chemical VAEs even more accessible.
