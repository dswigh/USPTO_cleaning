    Functionality:

    1) Data extracted from ORD comes in a large number of files (.pd.gz) batched in a large number of sub-folders. First step is to extract all filepaths that contain data of interest (e.g. everything if name_contains_substring is empty or only uspto data if name_contains_substring='uspto').
    2) Iteration over all filepaths to extract the following data:
        - The mapped reaction (unchanged)
        - Reactants, products, and agents (reagents, solvents and catalysts)
            - NB: If trust_labelling=True this info is extracted from .input and .outcomes labelling. If trust_labelling=False (default) it is extracted from the mapped reaction string & mapping is considered to reason on whether a molecule is a reactant, solvent, or agent.
        - Temperature: All temperatures were converted to Celcius. If only the control type was specified, the following mapping was used: 'AMBIENT' -> 25, 'ICE_BATH' -> 0, 'DRY_ICE' -> -78.5, 'LIQUID_NITROGEN' -> -196.
        - Time: All times were converted to hours.
        - Yield (for each product): The PERCENTAGEYIELD was preferred, but if this was not available, the CALCULATEDPERCENTYIELD was used instead. If neither was available, the value was set to None.
        - Procedure_details: Plain text string describing the procedure in English.
    3) Canonicalisation and light cleaning
        - All SMILES strings were canonicalised using RDKit.
        - A "replacements dictionary" was created to replace common names with their corresponding SMILES strings. This dictionary was created by iterating over the most common names in the dataset and replacing them with their corresponding SMILES strings. This was done semi-manually, with some dictionary entries coming from solvents.csv and others being added within the script (in the build_replacements function; mainly concerning catalysts).
        - The final light cleaning step depends on the value of trust_labelling (see above, in the Args section).
        - Reactions will only be added if the reactants and products are different (i.e. no crystalisation reactions etc.)
    4) Build a pandas DataFrame from this data (one for each ORD file), and save each as a pickle file
    5) Create a list of all molecule names and save as a pickle file. This comes in handy when performing name resolution (many molecules are represented with an english name as opposed to a smiles string). A molecule is understood as having an english name (as opposed to a SMILES string) if it is unresolvable by RDKit.
    6) Merge all the pickled lists of molecule names to create a list of unique molecule names (in merged_molecules_file eg "data/ORD/all_molecule_names.pkl").

    Output:

    1) A pickle file with the cleaned data for each folder of data. NB: Temp always in C, time always in hours
    2) A list of all unique molecule names (in merged_molecules_file)

    5) Create a list of all molecule names and save as a pickle file. This comes in handy when performing name resolution (many molecules are represented with an english name as opposed to a smiles string). A molecule is understood as having an english name (as opposed to a SMILES string) if it is unresolvable by RDKit.
    6) Merge all the pickled lists of molecule names to create a list of unique molecule names (in merged_molecules_file eg "data/ORD/all_molecule_names.pkl").

    Output:

    1) A pickle file with the cleaned data for each folder of data. NB: Temp always in C, time always in hours
    2) A list of all unique molecule names (in merged_molecules_file)
