"""
After running USPTO_extraction.py, this script will merge and apply further cleaning to the data.

    Example: 

python USPTO_cleaning.py --clean_data_file_name=cleaned_USPTO --consistent_yield=True --num_reactant=5 --num_product=5 --num_solv=2 --num_agent=3 --num_cat=0 --num_reag=0 --min_frequency_of_occurance_primary=15 --min_frequency_of_occurance_secondary=15 --include_other_category=True --save_with_label_called_other=10


    Args:
    
1) clean_data_file_name: (str) The filepath where the cleaned data will be saved
2) consistent_yield: (bool) Remove reactions with inconsistent reported yields (e.g. if the sum is under 0% or above 100%. Reactions with nan yields are not removed) 
3) - 8) num_reactant, num_product, num_solv, num_agent, num_cat, num_reag: (int) The number of molecules of that type to keep. Keep in mind that if merge_conditions=True in USPTO_extraction, there will only be agents, but no catalysts/reagents, and if merge_conditions=False, there will only be catalysts and reagents, but no agents. Agents should be seen as a 'parent' category of reagents and catalysts; solvents should fall under this category as well, but since the space of solvents is more well defined (and we have a list of the most industrially relevant solvents which we can refer to), we can separate out the solvents. Therefore, if merge_conditions=True, num_catalyst and num_reagent should be set to 0, and if merge_conditions=False, num_agent should be set to 0. It is recommended to set merge_conditions=True, as we don't believe that the original labelling of catalysts and reagents that reliable; furthermore, what constitutes a catalyst and what constitutes a reagent is not always clear, adding further ambiguity to the labelling, so it's probably best to merge these.
9) min_frequency_of_occurance_primary: (int) The minimum number of times a molecule must appear in the dataset to be kept. Infrequently occuring molecules will probably add more noise than signal to the dataset, so it is best to remove them. Primary: refers to the first index of columns of that type, ie solvent_0, agent_0, catalyst_0, reagent_0
10) min_frequency_of_occurance_secondary: (int) See above. Secondary: Any other columns than the first.
11) include_other_category (bool): Will save reactions with infrequent molecules (below min_frequency_of_occurance_primary/secondary but above save_with_label_called_other) by mapping these molecules to the string 'other'
12) save_with_label_called_other (int): Frequency cutoff (see above).

    Functionality:

1) Merge the pickle files from USPTO_extraction.py into a df
2) Remove reactions with too many reactants, products, sovlents, agents, catalysts, and reagents (num_reactant, num_product, num_solv, num_agent, num_cat, num_reag)
3) Remove reactions with inconsistent yields (consistent_yield)
4) Removal or remapping to 'other' of rare molecules
5) Remove reactions that have a molecule represented by an unresolvable name. This is often an english name or a number.
6) Remove duplicate reactions
7) Pickle the final df

    Output:

1) A pickle file containing the cleaned data

    NB:
1) There are lots of places where the code where I use masks to remove rows from a df. These operations could also be done in one line, however, using an operation such as .replace is very slow, and one-liners with dfs can lead to SettingWithCopyWarning. Therefore, I have opted to use masks, which are much faster, and don't give the warning.

#Still need to implement:
## Bundle all the solvents/reagents/catalysts together
## Apply a map to extract the solvents, given a list of solvents from Summit
## Place metals as the first reagent to give the model the chance to predcit solvents
