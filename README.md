# USPTO_cleaning
Cleaning and extraction of USPTO data from ORD

The scripts herein will extract and clean USPTO data from ORD with various manual steps relying on chemical domain knowledge. This results in an open-source dataset containing a mapped reaction, reactants, products, solvents, reagents, catalysts, and yields in a pandas DataFrame structure that should also be easily usable by people with little knowledge of chemistry.

# Instructions
1) Git clone this repo
2) Download the USPTO data from ORD into data/USPTO/:
    - While inside USPTO: 
```    
git clone https://github.com/open-reaction-database/ord-data
```
    - You'll find the data in ord-data/data/
    - You'll notice that the data is split into folders, each containing a number of ORD files. They are batched by year.
3) Run the following command in the root directory (This took 19 min on a mac studio):
```
python USPTO_extraction.py True
```
    - For alternate usage, see the documentation in the corresponsing file
4) Run the following command in the root director (This took 8 min on a mac studio):

```
python USPTO_cleaning.py --clean_data_file_name=cleaned_USPTO --consistent_yield=True --num_reactant=5 --num_product=5 --num_solv=2 --num_agent=3 --num_cat=0 --num_reag=0 --min_frequency_of_occurance=100
```

For alternate usage, see the documentation in the corresponsing file
5) Find the cleaned USPTO data in the data folder 



For ubuntu: 
```
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```


## Solvents
In data/solvents.csv you'll find a list of solvens which we use to label solvents (to avoid relying on the labelling in USPTO), this list was created from the intersection of the following two lists (excluding acids, bases, and polymers):

 - https://github.com/sustainable-processes/summit/blob/main/data/ucb_pharma_approved_list.csv
